    - `fs`: Node.js package for file system operations.
    - `chai`: Assertion library for test validation.

    Environment:
    - Node.js environment required for running the test suite.
    - Firefox browser used for headless testing.
    - "mochawesome" - used for Generating HTML and JSON Reports

5. Constraints and Assumptions

    - The test suite assumes the presence of a static HTML page located in the `src` directory.
    - All tests are executed in a headless Firefox browser environment.
    - Test correctness depends on accurate element selectors and expected values.
    - Development and testing are constrained by available time and resources.
