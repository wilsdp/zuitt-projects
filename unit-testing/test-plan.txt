        - Confirm the presence of a link to GitLab on the portfolio page.
     8. Test Case 8: Page has a link to GitHub
        - Ensure the availability of a link to GitHub on the portfolio page.
     9. Test Case 9: Page has a link to Facebook
        - Validate the existence of a link to Facebook on the portfolio page.
     10. Test Case 10: Page has a link to LinkedIn
         - Confirm the presence of a link to LinkedIn on the portfolio page.
     11. Test Case 11: Page has a contact form
         - Ensure the presence of at least one contact form on the portfolio page.
     12. Test Case 12: Page has a text input in the contact form
         - Validate the existence of text input fields within the contact form.
     13. Test Case 13: Page has an email input in the contact form
         - Confirm the presence of email input fields within the contact form.
     14. Test Case 14: Page has a textarea in the contact form
         - Ensure the availability of a textarea element within the contact form.

4. Test Environment

   - Environment:
     - Utilize a testing environment equipped with Selenium WebDriver, Mocha framework, Chai assertion library, and Node.js for executing automated UI tests.

5. Execution and Reporting

   - Execution:
     - Execute the test cases using the Mocha framework integrated with Selenium WebDriver to interact with and validate the portfolio page's UI components.
   - Reporting:
     - Utilize Mocha Reporter to log test results, including the pass/fail status, in a structured format for analysis and debugging purposes.

6. Schedule

   - Timeline:
     - Conduct UI testing parallel to the development phase, ensuring continuous integration with each build and pre-release testing before major deployments.
